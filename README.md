Weather Tracker D20
Originally built by Tyelor D. Klein - March 2019

This is a small tool built for tracking dates, notes, and generating weather in table top roleplaying games like Pathfinder and D&amp;D 3.5e. This specific build is for Paizo's Pathfinder world Golarion.


How to use:
To use the tool use the Advance Day buttons to change the current day, select dates on the calendar to view that date and enter notes or generate weather for the selected day.

Right click on the Advance Day buttons to decrease the current day by that button's amount.

Use the Generate Weather buttons to generate weather for the select day and on. Currently the weather is based on a colder northern climate, but can be modified in code to generate different climates (I will be making this easier in future iterations).

Right click on the Generate Weather buttons to clear the weather from the selected day and the next days based on the button's amount.

Type into the general notes box in order to keep track of notes that you want to persist from day to day.

Type into the daily notes box to change the notes for the selected day.

Hover the mouse over the weather in order to see the penalties that the creatures exposed to the weather will incur (the penalties shouldn't stack, use the worse penalty from any weather element's penalty).

Use the menu buttons to Save and Load specific Calendars. Note that the currently opened calendar will automatically be saved on exiting the application, and the last opened calendar will automatically be loaded upon starting the application.

To change the calendar to fit a different world requires changing several static fields throughout the application, and in the future customization will be much easier.

Updates:
